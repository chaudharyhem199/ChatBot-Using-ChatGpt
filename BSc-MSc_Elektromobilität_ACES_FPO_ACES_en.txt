Section 36 Bachelor’s Degree Program, Start of Studies, Related Degree Programs
(1) During the Bachelor's degree program in Electromobility ACES, students acquire
skills in the core subjects of engineering, engineering mathematics and in a selection
of the following areas:
1. AI and autonomous driving
2. Connectivity
3. E-powertrain
4. Sustainable mobility and production technology.
(2) The Bachelor’s degree program shall cover the modules listed in Appendix 1.
(3) The degree program shall start in the winter semester.
(4) 1The following Bachelor’s degree programs are considered subject-related degree
programs within the meaning of Section 24 (1)(2)(2) ABMPO/TechFak:
1. Mechanical Engineering
2. Mechatronics
3. Industrial Engineering
4. International Production Engineering and Management
5. Technical Vocational Education and Training.
2In justified cases, the Degree Program Committee may allow exceptions from sentence 1.
Section 37 Master’s Degree Program, Standard Duration of Studies, Start of Degree Program,
Related Degree Programs, Teaching and Examination Language
(1) 1The Master’s degree program builds on the content of the Bachelor’s degree program. 2Section 36 (1) shall apply accordingly with the proviso that existing skills are
extended and built upon accordingly.
(2) The Master’s degree program shall comprise the modules in Appendix 2a (fulltime degree program) or 2b (part-time degree program).

Part II: Special Provisions
1. Bachelor’s Examination
Section 38 Scope of the Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung
The Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) includes the modules marked
‘GOP’ in Appendix 1.
Section 39 Scope and Structure of the Bachelor’s Examination
Bachelor's examination comprises the modules in Appendix 1 amounting to 180
ECTS credits. 2The relevant Appendix also states the type and scope of examinations,

1Bachelor’s

(2) 1The first learning outcome of these modules is to allow students to choose the
areas they intend to specialize in pursuant to Section 36 (1). 2The second learning
outcome has a research focus, with students learning methods of research applicable
to their subject and exploring their subject in more depth to Bachelor’s degree level.
3Thirdly, the element of choice allows students to tailor their profile in view of their
career plans. 4The type and scope of examinations depend on the skills taught in the
relevant modules (generally worth 5 ECTS credits) pursuant to sentences 1 to 3 and
(2) as well as the module handbook.
(3) 1One examination achievement is stipulated per module. 2Examinations in the modules shall take one of the following forms: written examination (60, 90, 120 min), oral
examination (20–30 min), seminar achievement, tutorial achievement or practical
achievement pursuant to Section 6(3) ABMPO/TechFak. 3 Section 6 (2)(3) ABMPO/TechFak stipulates that in justified exceptional circumstances, combinations of
the individual achievements stated in sentence 7 may also be possible. 4Other examination forms are possible if so decided by the Degree Program Committee.
(4) 1The specialization modules are generally worth 5 ECTS credits (typically lecture
and tutorial). 2Any exceptions to the size of the module and combinations of teaching
units are detailed in the module handbook.
(5) The Degree Program Committee can approve other specializations and modules
pursuant to (1) upon request.

of the ECTS credits achieved in one of these areas exceeds the number of ECTS
credits stipulated in the Appendix, an interim grade shall be calculated according to
the ECTS weighting of the individual modules and this shall be counted towards the
final grade with the number of ECTS credits stipulated for the area in question. 3Sentence 1 shall apply accordingly to modules with several partial achievements.
2. Master’s Examination

Due to the specific subject skills that must be acquired as part of the learning outcome of the Master’s degree program, students are expected to
prove on the basis of the module description that they will acquire additional skills compared to those acquired in their previous Bachelor’s degree
and to provide proof of meeting any requirements stipulated during the qualification assessment process. This is detailed in the relevant module
description in the context of the learning outcomes of the Master’s degree program.

11

see Section 45 (5) The admissions committee may stipulate certain modules from the Bachelor’s degree program (Appendix 1) and suitable language
courses that applicants have not already completed during their previous studies to compensate for skills they are lacking.
3) see Section 46(3) or (4) The type and scope of the examination depend on the specific manner in which the respective module is taught; see module
handbook for details.
4) see module handbook; footnote 2 notwithstanding, the following applies: pursuant to Section 28 ABMPO/TechFak, failed attempts are not counted
