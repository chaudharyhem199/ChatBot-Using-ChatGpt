# ChatBot-Using-ChatGpt
This is a chatbot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concept to respond to questions tailored to specific contexts.

This chatbot, operating within the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), represents a approach to natural language understanding and generation. By integrating retrieval-based methods with advanced generation models, such as GPT, RAG enables the system to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then generate responses tailored to the user's queries. This combination not only enhances the system's ability to understand and respond to diverse questions but also ensures that the responses are contextually relevant and informative. As a result, RAG-based chatbots offer users a more engaging and satisfying conversational experience across a wide range of topics and domains.
